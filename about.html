  <p class="mb-4">
    I’m a Data Scientist and Subject Matter Expert in Large Language Models (LLMs) with experience in fine-tuning foundational models like <strong>Google Gemini</strong>, building data pipelines, and deploying NLP/ML systems on the cloud.

  <p class="mb-4">
    My work spans across Google Gemini’s ICE initiatives, where I’ve built APIs, automated slide generation via Google Slides API, and created scalable pipelines using GCP (BigQuery, Cloud SQL, GCS).
